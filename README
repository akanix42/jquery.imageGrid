Description:
The jQuery Image Grid provides the user with a simple way of creating a grid of images (or other content) from an array.
The user specifies the number of rows and columns per page as well as the width and height of a cell; the plugin handles the rest.
The cell formatting can easily be overridden for custom content.
The plugin includes paging (through the use of the included jquery.pager plugin) and allows for easy addition of events such as hover.

Installation: 
Required: Copy the jquery.imageGrid.js file to your scripts folder.
Optional: 
	For a bit of default formmating, copy the jquery.imageGrid.css file to your css folder.
	For paging functionality, copy jquery.pager.js to your scripts folder.
	For the cell hover overlay extension, copy jquery.imageGrid.cellHoverOverlay.js to your scripts folder.

Help:
There are 3 examples included - check them out. They will help you understand the plugin's features.
